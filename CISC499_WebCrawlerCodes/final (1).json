MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry.

Currently, this is taken advantage of by the most valuable companies in Silicon Valley, the most powerful governmental agencies, and the most influential social movements. What they have in common is that they use computational tools to understand, and ultimately influence human behavior and social dynamics.\n\nAn increasing part of human interaction leaves a massive digital footprint behind. Studying it allows us to gain unprecedented insights into what society is and how it works, including its intricate social networks that had long been obscure. Computational power allows us to detect hidden patterns through analytical tools like machine learning and to natural language processing. Finally, computer simulations enable us to explore hypothetical situations that may not even exist in reality, but that we would like to exist: a better world.\n\nThis specialization serves as a multidisciplinary, multi-perspective, and multi-method guide on how to better understand society and human behavior with modern research tools. This specialization gives you easy access to some of the exciting new possibilities of how to study society and human behavior.

The second module focuses on the forces that drive the industry's operations, the oil and gas markets, including the cost of wells, seasonal impacts on prices, and the role of oil reserves. After every lesson, learners will take short quizzes to test their newly acquired knowledge, participant in crowd-sourced discussions about global markets, and complete a final project.", "type": "Physical Science and Engineering", "difficulty": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 4979, "rating": 4.793733681462141, "price": true, "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/oilandgas", "domain": "Coursera"}, {"title": "Circular Economy - Sustainable Materials Management", "instructor": "['Philip Peck', 'Jessika Luth Richter', 'Karl Vrancken', 'Saskia Manshoven', 'Jeroen Gillabel', 'Erika Faigen', 'Konstantinos Modis', 'Sophie Sfez', 'Julia Nu\u00c3\\x9fholz', 'Katherine Whalen', 'David Peck', 'Dr. Yuliya Voytenko Palgan']", "description": "This course looks at where important materials in products we use every day come from and how these materials can be used more efficiently, longer, and in closed loops.
